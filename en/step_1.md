A <span style="color: #0faeb0">sensory gadget</span> is something that makes you want to keep interacting with it. A fidget toy is a type of sensory gadget that helps the user relieve stress or improve their concentration. An adaptive gadget can be used by people with physical disabilities for communication. A sensory gadget might stimulate all the senses or just focus on one.
</p>

You will:
+ Use your digital making skills to design and make a gadget for a user
+ Use physical inputs such as buttons and potentiometers to control physical outputs such as LEDs and a buzzer
+ Let others try our your gadget and improve it based on their feedback

### Try it

Watch the video below. Which senses are being stimulated? What output occurs when each input is used?

**An assistive gadget**
A user can select an option to let their carer know of their current need. Once they have made a selection, they press another button which alerts their carer.

### PROJECT BRIEF: Project title
<hr style="border-top: 2px solid black;">

Brief explanation of aims of project. 

Your sensory gadget should:
+ Have multiple different kinds of input
+ Have multiple different outputs
+ Be appealing to the user and robust enough to be used

Your sensory gadget could:
+ Take ergonomics like user comfort into consideration
+ Reset on user input or after a set amount of time 
+ Connect to a specific theme

### Get inspiration

--- task ---

Think about the sensory gadget that you would like to make as you investigate these example projects:

**The night sky**
Tiny holes have been poked through a piece of black card to make a night sky effect on a ceiling in a dark room. An RGB LED pulses to create a twinkling effect. A button is used to switch the light on and off.

**The buzzy bee**
The bee's wings have kitchen foil on the back of them and when pressed down they connect to another piece of foil on the card - this makes a buzzer play a note. Each wing plays a different sound. A potentiometer controls a blue LED on the bee's tail.

**Picosaber**
Pressing the button lights the blade of the saber and starts the buzzers making a humming sound. Turning the potentiometer changes the colour of the blade and pitch of the hum. Turning the potentiometer all the way down plays a 'power-down sound' then switches off the lights and buzzers.
