**The Night Sky**

The original **Night Sky** project used a single RGBLED and a piece of card with holes poked through it to simulate a starry sky using projected light, which could be turned on and off by a button. 

This upgraded version of the project adds another RGBLED to increase the brightness, and adds a diffuser for the LEDs to spread the light around more widely. 

The card with holes has been replaced by a lasercut dodecahedron, with the logos of popular superheroes used as cutouts to project the light into the room.
